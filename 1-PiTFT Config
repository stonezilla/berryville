//Installer script
//This script will do all the work for you, and install both device tree overlay support as well as configure rotation and any HDMI mirroring. PiTFT no longer needs any custom kernels or modules, so you can continue to update/upgrade your Pi and it will work with the most recent releases.
//Here's the commands to run. Make sure your Pi has network access, it needs to download the software!
//The latest installer script was rewritten in Python, so it can be installed with just a few commands. First, start by installing a few dependencies and downloading the repo:

cd ~
sudo apt-get install -y git python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade adafruit-python-shell click
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts.git
cd Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts

//Interactive Installation
//For an interactive install, you can just run the script without any options:

sudo python3 adafruit-pitft.py

//Once you run it you will be presented with menus for configuration.
