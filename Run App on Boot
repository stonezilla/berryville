//Run GUI Programs on Startup With Autostart
//Autostart is the best way to run GUI-based Raspberry Pi programs on startup. It works by ensuring that both the X Window system and the LXDE desktop environment are available before the system runs any of the scheduled programs.

sudo nano /etc/xdg/autostart/death_watch_01.desktop

//In the .desktop file, add the following lines of code:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Death Watch 01
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/death_watch_01.py

//After that, save the file, and then restart the Pi.
